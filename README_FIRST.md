# 🎯 START HERE - Smarter Pre-Med Rebuilt

## What I Did

I completely rebuilt the results page to match your "Holy Shit!" mockups. The UI now delivers that premium, interactive experience you envisioned.

---

## 🚀 What You Have Now

### The Big Feature: **Cohort Comparison Dashboard**

Instead of just showing "here's your cohort," students now get:

1. **Interactive comparison** - Click any of 5 cohort buttons
2. **Dual-overlay radar chart** - Pink (their profile) vs Blue (cohort archetype)
3. **Rich context** - Why it fits, what schools prioritize, example schools
4. **Strategic guidance** - Specific next steps for each cohort

### The "Wow!" Moment

When students click through different cohorts:
- Chart updates instantly showing their profile vs that cohort
- Panels update with cohort-specific content
- They see real school names (Duke, Mount Sinai, etc.)
- They understand exactly where they match and where they have gaps

## 🔜 Next Step: Wire Real AI

Once you've seen the UI and deployed it, we can:

1. Connect to Anthropic API
2. Build scoring logic using your data
3. Replace placeholder scores with real analysis
4. Map questionnaire responses to competency scores
5. Classify students into cohorts based on their responses

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

**Why dual-overlay chart?**
- Shows exactly where student matches vs gaps
- Visual, intuitive comparison
- More actionable than just showing their scores

**Why interactive cohort selector?**
- Students explore different paths
- Removes guesswork from application process
- Empowers strategic decisions

**Why example schools?**
- Makes it concrete and actionable
- Students can research these schools
- Shows real targets aligned with their profile

---

## 🎯 The Vision Realized

Your mockups showed:
> "Zach begins to sense where he might fit best... their priorities resonate with him"

The UI now delivers exactly that:
- Students explore, don't just receive a verdict
- They see multiple possibilities
- They understand the "why" behind each match
- They get specific, actionable guidance
