## 🚀 What You Have Now

### **Cohort Comparison Dashboard** (Main Feature)

Students get an interactive exploration experience:

1. **Interactive comparison** - Click any of 5 cohort buttons
2. **Dual-overlay radar chart** - Pink (their profile) vs Blue (cohort archetype)
3. **Rich context** - Fit analysis, strategic guidance, example schools
4. **Mobile-first responsive design** - Perfect on all devices

### The "Wow!" Moment

When students click through different cohorts:
- Chart updates with smooth transitions
- Text fades between cohort-specific analysis
- They see real school names (Duke, Mount Sinai, etc.)
- They understand exactly where they match and where they have gaps

## 🔜 Day Two: Backend Integration & Real AI Analysis

Now that the UI is polished and production-ready, Day Two focuses on:

### Backend Integration
1. **Connect to Anthropic API** - Wire up real AI analysis
2. **Build scoring logic** - Map questionnaire responses to 6 competency scores
3. **Implement cohort classification** - Algorithm to rank user fit across all cohorts
4. **Replace placeholder data** - Real analysis instead of mock scores
5. **Generate personalized guidance** - AI-written fit analysis for each student

### Technical Tasks
- [ ] Create API route handler (`/api/analyze`)
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for competency scoring
- [ ] Build cohort ranking algorithm
- [ ] Wire up results page to use real data
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Test with various questionnaire inputs

## 💡 Key Design Decisions (Day One)

**Why dual-overlay chart?**
- Shows exactly where student matches vs gaps
- Visual, intuitive comparison
- More actionable than just showing their scores

**Why interactive cohort selector?**
- Students explore different paths
- Removes guesswork from application process
- Empowers strategic decisions

**Why card-based sidebar?**
- Equal visual weight with chart card
- Cohort selector feels integrated, not tacked on
- Maintains clean grid alignment

**Why mobile-first responsive?**
- Most students will access on mobile devices
- Ensures great experience across all screen sizes
- Grid layout naturally adapts to small screens

## 🎯 The Vision Realized

Your mockups showed:
> "Zach begins to sense where he might fit best... their priorities resonate with him"

The UI now delivers exactly that:
- Students explore, don't just receive a verdict
- They see multiple possibilities
- They understand the "why" behind each match
- They get specific, actionable guidance
- **Pixel-perfect Apple-level polish throughout**
