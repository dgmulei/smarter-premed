# Smarter Pre-Med

A focused pre-med assessment tool that helps students discover their medical school cohort profile in 60 seconds.

## The Vision

**The "Holy Shit" Moment:** A pre-med student answers 8 targeted questions, and instantly sees:
- A radar chart visualizing their competitive profile across 6 key competencies
- Their ideal medical school cohort classification
- Clear understanding of where they stand

No document upload. No chat. No complexity. Just clarity.

## Features

- **8-Question Assessment**: Targeted questions about GPA, clinical hours, research, leadership, and unique experiences
- **Radar Chart Visualization**: Beautiful, screenshot-worthy visualization of 6 competency dimensions
- **Cohort Classification**: Identifies which of 5 medical school cohorts best matches the student's profile
- **Premium UI**: Glassmorphism effects, smooth animations, sophisticated design

## The 6 Competencies

2. **Clinical Exposure** - Patient contact hours and clinical experience
3. **Research Activities** - Research experience and publications
4. **Leadership & Service** - Leadership roles and community service
5. **Technical Skills** - Clinical work experience (EMT, scribe, etc.)
6. **Specialty Preparation** - Focus and commitment to specific medical path

## The 5 Cohorts

1. **Clinical-Investigative** - Research + clinical excellence
2. **Patient-Centered** - Strong clinical focus, service orientation
3. **Community-Clinical** - Underserved populations, primary care
4. **Research-Intensive** - Heavy research emphasis
5. **Mission-Driven** - Specific specialty/population focus
