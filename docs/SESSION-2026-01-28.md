## Duration
Extended session (context compaction occurred mid-session)

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Strategic Decision: Standalone vs Platform
- **Decision**: Keep Positioned as standalone single-purpose tool (Option A)
- **Rationale**: Build reputation with one excellent tool before expanding
- **Parked features**: Personalized Profile Report, Custom Action Plan, Detailed School List, Prereq Check-Up

### 2. Messaging Blurbs Created
Three versions for different audiences:

**Direct-to-student:**
> You're putting in the work — but which med schools actually fit your profile? Positioned maps your strengths across 6 competencies and shows where you're built to stand out. Free, no account needed.

**Counselor-to-counselor:**
> Detailed version listing all 6 competencies (academics, clinical, research, leadership, technical skills, specialty clarity)

**Counselor-to-student:**
> Warm forwarding version: "Found this tool called 'Positioned'..." - takes 10 minutes

### 3. Custom Domain Setup
- **Domain**: `smarterpremed.com` (already owned on Namecheap, was in grace period)
- **DNS**: Transferred to Cloudflare
- **Records**: A record → 76.76.21.21, CNAME www → cname.vercel-dns.com
- **Vercel**: Domain added and verified
- **Result**: https://smarterpremed.com live

### 4. Open Graph Image
- **File**: `public/og-image.png` (1200x630px)
- **Design**: Stripped down to essentials - "Positioned", "smarterpremed.com", tagline, unlabeled radar chart
- **Template**: `og-image.html` created for future regeneration
- **Iterations**: Started with labeled chart, removed labels (illegible at thumbnail size), simplified branding

### 5. Meta Tags
- **Updated**: `app/layout.tsx` with comprehensive OG and Twitter meta tags
- **Title**: "Positioned | See Where You Stand"
- **Description**: Matches student blurb
- **Verified**: Working in iMessage preview

### 6. Contact Email
- **Address**: `hello@smarterpremed.com`
- **Routing**: Cloudflare Email Routing → dgmulei@gmail.com
- **Subject line**: "Positioned" (simplified from "Positioned Feedback")
- **Footer**: Added to both landing and results pages

### 7. Database Storage
- **Schema extended**: Added `questionnaire_responses` (JSONB) and `top_cohort` (VARCHAR)
- **Created**: `lib/db.ts` with database utilities
- **Updated**: `/api/submit-email` to store questionnaire responses
- **Updated**: `/api/analyze` to save top_cohort after Claude analysis
- **Updated**: Frontend to pass submissionId through flow
- **Verified**: Test submission shows questionnaire data and top_cohort in database
