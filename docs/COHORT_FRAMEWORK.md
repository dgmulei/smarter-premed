# Whitecoat Cohort Framework

**Proprietary classification system for 173 US and Canadian medical schools.**

Version 1.0 | Last Updated: January 13, 2025

---

## Overview

The Whitecoat Cohort Framework categorizes medical schools into five distinct groups based on institutional goals, curricular focus, and applicant expectations. This data-driven classification is derived from AAMC Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) data, institutional mission statements, and admissions patterns.

### The Five Cohorts

1. **Mission-Driven** - Health equity and underserved populations
2. **Patient-Centered** - Communication and patient engagement
3. **Community-Clinical** - Primary care and public health
4. **Clinical-Investigative** - Integration of research and clinical practice
5. **Research-Intensive** - High NIH funding and scientific inquiry

## Cohort-Specific Weighting Insights

### Academic Metrics (GPA vs MCAT)

- **Higher GPA Emphasis**: Mission-Driven, Community-Clinical (more forgiving on test scores with strong service)
- **Balanced Approach**: Patient-Centered (both matter equally)
- **Higher MCAT Emphasis**: Clinical-Investigative, Research-Intensive (analytical capability crucial)

### Service & Leadership

- **Quality over Quantity**: Mission-Driven, Patient-Centered (sustained depth matters)
- **Team-Based Valued**: Community-Clinical, Patient-Centered (collaborative efforts highlighted)
- **Solo + Team Balanced**: Clinical-Investigative, Research-Intensive (both valued)

### Research Expectations

- **Minimal**: Mission-Driven (200-400 hours acceptable)
- **Moderate**: Patient-Centered, Community-Clinical (100-500 hours)
- **Substantial**: Clinical-Investigative (400-800 hours)
- **Extensive**: Research-Intensive (1,200-1,500+ hours with publications)

## Methodology & Sources

### Cohort Definition and Validation

The framework is built on:

1. **AAMC MSAR Data**: Quantitative benchmarks (GPA, MCAT, matriculant statistics)
2. **Institutional Mission Statements**: Publicly stated priorities and values
3. **Curriculum Analysis**: Required coursework, clinical integration, research opportunities
4. **Admissions Patterns**: Holistic review of successful applicant profiles

### Data Collection Process

1. Analyzed 173 accredited medical schools (156 US + 17 Canadian)
2. Extracted median GPA/MCAT, clinical hour expectations, research requirements
3. Identified institutional indicators (NIH funding, mission focus, curriculum structure)
4. Validated cohorts through cross-referencing multiple sources

### Literature and Data Sources

- **AAMC Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR)**: Primary data source
- **Institutional websites**: Mission statements, curriculum details
- **NIH RePORTER**: Research funding data
- **US News & World Report**: Research rankings (supplementary)
- **School-specific admissions data**: Published class profiles

## Using the Framework

### For Students

**Identify your profile**:
1. Calculate your GPA/MCAT against cohort benchmarks
2. Inventory clinical hours, settings, and longitudinal commitment
3. Assess research engagement (hours, outputs, independence)
4. Evaluate leadership and service scale
5. Determine which cohort(s) align with your strengths

**Strategic application**:
- Apply to schools across 2-3 cohorts that match your profile
- Don't overreach into cohorts where you significantly lack benchmarks
- Build missing experiences to shift cohort fit over time

### For Advisors

**Use framework for**:
1. Gap analysis (what's missing for target cohort?)
2. School list building (which cohorts are realistic?)
3. Timeline planning (how long to close gaps?)
4. Narrative development (align story with cohort values)

**Remember**: Cohorts are guides, not rigid boxes. Some schools span multiple cohorts, and individual applicants may fit differently than aggregate data suggests.

---

## Limitations

1. **Cohort Overlap**: Some schools (e.g., Yale, UW-Madison) span multiple cohorts
2. **Within-Cohort Variability**: Harvard ≠ Mayo even though both are Research-Intensive
3. **Year-to-Year Changes**: Medians shift; framework based on 2023-2024 MSAR data
4. **Holistic Review**: Numbers aren't everything—narrative and fit matter enormously
