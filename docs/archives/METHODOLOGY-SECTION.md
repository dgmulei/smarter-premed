## About the Whitecoat Cohort System

The Whitecoat Framework is a research-based classification system developed through systematic analysis of 173 AAMC-accredited U.S. and Canadian medical schools. Using data from the Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) database, institutional websites, and published mission statements, Smarter Premed categorized schools into five cohorts based on measurable institutional priorities and applicant expectations.

Each cohort reflects what schools actually prioritize—not prestige rankings. Mission-Driven ("Mission") schools emphasize health equity and community engagement. Patient-Centered ("Bedside") schools focus on communication and longitudinal clinical experiences. Community-Clinical ("Community") schools integrate primary care with public health. Clinical-Investigative ("Translate") schools bridge research and patient care. Research-Intensive ("Discover") schools advance medical science through high NIH funding and MD-PhD programs.

Schools were validated against quantitative benchmarks (median GPA/MCAT ranges, expected clinical hours, research outputs, NIH funding levels) and qualitative institutional indicators (curriculum structure, research programs, community partnerships). This evidence-based system helps students identify schools aligned with their demonstrated strengths and career goals.
